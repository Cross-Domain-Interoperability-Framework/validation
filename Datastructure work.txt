So I've tried to construct a dataset description using the Dataset/Datastructure/DataStructurecomponent route. This is for an XAS NEXUS file, one of the variables haa a value that is an array of all the data. The original data has 32 columns, I trimmed it down to 9 columns for this test. The structure of the 9 column array is described in cdi:isStructuredBy/has_DataStructureComponent/"@type": "cdi:WideDataStructure"/has_DataStructureComponent. Each component has an index position in the array and a link to an InstanceVariable that is 'uses' 

the schema:variableMeasured list includes the top level variables in the NetCDF file, as well as the column variables in the scan/data array. 

in the distribution, there is a StructuredDataMapping to the InstanceVariables at the top level, these are 1-D arrays except for scan/data, which is a 443 row by 9 column array, described by a dataStructure data compononent as a wide dataset.

what do we need to know:
dataset contains variables
	what property does each variable quantify
what kind of value does the variable have	
	some are quantified with a single value (integer, decimal, boolean, string...(enum))
		simple datatype with value domains
	some might have array values.  
		need to describe array as wide data structure. columns in array are variables, each simple or object 
	some might have object values
		describe variables nested in entities. represent class/entity-attribute/property structure
